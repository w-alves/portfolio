  Some companies would like to know who are the other companies in a given market that are most likely to become their next customers. Therefore, this project is about the   development of a product to provide an automated service that recommends leads to a user, given his current list of customers (portfolio).

  In the age of technology, the concern with information security is increasingly latent and one of the sectors that seek to improve fraud prevention is credit cards.  Here, in this project, we will predict a credit card fraud using the dataset creditcardfraud, wich has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Université Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection
